            <p class="message">Dear Mr. Barral,</p>
            <p class="message1">
                First of all, I would like to apologize sir for what we had done last Saturday. I know that you are very disappointed and heartbroken because of it.
                I would not make any excuses for our actions, especially my action. You already warned us before and we were not able to abide by it. I'm also sorry
                sir because it took some time for me to personally send this to you. I was also overwhelmed and scared to be responsible with my mistake. I remember 
                your advice that people who often helps might be taken advantage of in the future. I am so thankful that you said that instead of just saying that
                the people who cheated don't have a future, it shows how you genuinely care for us.</p>
            <p class="message2">
                This incident was undoubtedly the first boom in my college years, but I also know that it will leave a scar on your faith in others. 
                I will not ask for your trust again, sir, but I would want to tell you that as your student the classes were very memorable and nurturing for 
                me. Despite your fury for us, you still cared for us, and honestly sir, the assurance and quotes you shared truly helped me, and I'm very grateful
                gyud kaayo sir. I learnt so much from you, and I hope this letter proves that.</p>
